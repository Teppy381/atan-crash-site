# Crash Site

Adds a small generator, lab and assembling machines to the crash site.

These buildings [were removed](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-359) from the base game. This mod adds them back in.

They allow you to kick start your early game, automating and researching sooner.

Included:

* 1 Generator, which provides almost enough power to run the other two machines
* 1 Lab, which researches slower (0.75 speed) than a normal Lab and can only accept automation science packs
* 2 Assembling machines, which craft slower (0.33 speed) than an Assembling machine 1

None of these can use modules.

When deconstructed they provide a small amount of useful basic items.

Entities are added to a *new* Freeplay game; does nothing if added to an existing save.

## Alternatives

[Krastorio 2](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Krastorio2) and other overhauls also start with these buildings on the map.

[Factorio crash site (and legacy items)](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/factorio-crash-site) (a dependency of this mod) makes these building available to modders, but does not add them into the game.

If you just want the crash site buildings without a full overhaul, this mod is for you.
